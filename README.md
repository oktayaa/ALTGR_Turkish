# ALTGR_Turkish
Windows US English keyboard layout for typing TURKISH characters using the ALT_GR (right ALT key).


This layout for users who are familiar with the US English Q keyboard layout. (Actual physical keyboard layout does not matter)
You can use all English layout functionality without change only using the ALT_GR key when a Turkish-only character is needed.
Since these keys do not exist in a regular English encoding, applications using it must support UTF-8.

Example: To type ı,  hold down ALT_GR and input i.  To type İ, hold down ALT_GR and SHIFT and input i.
