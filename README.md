# Turkish ALT_GR keyboard layout for Windows
Windows US English keyboard layout for typing TURKISH characters using the ALT_GR (right ALT key).


This layout for users who are familiar with the US English Q keyboard layout. (Actual physical keyboard layout does not matter)
You can use all English layout functionality without change only using the ALT_GR key when a Turkish-only character is needed.
Since these keys do not exist in a regular English encoding, applications using it must support UTF-8.

Example: To type ı,  hold down ALT_GR and input i.  To type İ, hold down ALT_GR and SHIFT and input i.


You can download the install package from the Releases area or download the source file (US-AGRTR.klc) and compile your own package by loading the source file  into 

Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator (MSKLC) (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102134).
